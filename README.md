# Scream
Scream is a WhatsApp crash tool built on python.
Scream is a WhatsApp crash tool I built. Rather that sending Junk texts, Scream converts your message to ASCII characters, then adds special characters that become invisible in normal text. Making enough of these characters can cause a WhatsApp account to lag, hang, crash. And with enough intensity damage it can crash the phone services.

The library for automating this crash only works on PC, so open up your laptop, open chrome and set up web WhatsApp, then run the tool in your python IDE. This isn't a major project, I just made it to see if I could scrap junk texts and use usual messages to dos the application. 

Scream has 5levels of damage, starting from level 1, which generates 100k Special ASCII characters for the crash. This is an open source tool, meaning obviously you can edit the code to your liking. Don't mind the comments and debugging "print" functions, I was in a rush, I did it last night and I haven't had much chance to test the full capabilities.
